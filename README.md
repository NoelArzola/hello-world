Hello, world!

I'm a developer that started his love for computers in grade school using programs, playing PC games, and fighting a lot in DOS and command prompt. 

A few years later I received my first computing certificate at age ten (computer camp what what lol). 

In middle school I started tinkering on the inside and learning how to replace hardware or fix their issues. 

By high school I was making money optimizing, upgrading, and cleaning PCs (so. many. viruses.). 

In college I had a hard drive die in my laptop (the first of many travesties, luckily my Dell was 10/10 on the repair scale). On my new hard drive I installed Ubuntu and fell in love with Linux. Ubuntu was not plug and play as it is today, so I got very comfortable spending hours in the terminal because if I didn't break something, an apt update was sure to anyway. 

I guess I was kind of coding without realizing it, as I started writing scripts to automate tasks I was doing repeatedly to save time. 

Fast forward a few years after graduating college and I started learning Python, but eventually my already scarce free material was only taking me so far. 

In 2018 I began to learn again, this time choosing JavaScript (Python, I WILL be back to conquer you!) and not being as hard on myself. I really enjoyed it and now I've tacked on HTML/CSS and SQL. 

I want to develop full-time, so now I'm getting familiar with GIT.
